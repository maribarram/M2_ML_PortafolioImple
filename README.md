# M2_ML_PortafolioImple
### Marcela Ibarra Mora A01231973

In this project, I implemented a logistic regression algorithm only using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib frameworks. Making use of the wine dataset, the algorithm can predict the three wine classes (class 1, class 2 and class 3). For this implementation I selected the columns: "Alcohol" and "Color intensity" to predict the wine class. 


Input: 

	wine.data
	
Output: 

	A graph of the mean error of the parameters for each class.
	The final parameters for each class. ([m1,m2,b])

Posible improvement: 
	-Due to the amount of data and the type of regression, the error is considerable. But for future improvements, it would be necessary to modify the hyperparameters such as lr to obtain better results.
	
## How to run

Download the folder and run:

	python Reg_log.py
